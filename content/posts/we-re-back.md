I wanted a platform to write posts on and remembered that I'd set this site up with a static site
generator a while back (spoiler: it was 5 years ago!), so we're back up and running.

In the meantime Python 2 was deprecated (end of life was already over a year ago) and the site
generator I was using before, Cactus, was never updated for Python 3. So I've quickly ported
the site to [Zola](https://www.getzola.org) instead.

I'll be back with more updates soon (I promise), although probably a different focus to what I
had imaged in 2016.
