Having had some success recently writing cross platform desktop applications using [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/). I'm gradually transitioning the project to Flow to try and improve my confidence in the code. Still, I wanted to try out something a bit more purely functional. So, I've been looking into [ClojureScript](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript), for which there are a number of bindings for React.

This page is more a resource for me than anything else. Some useful links I've found while hunting around.
